# An overview

-   build with: Python Flask
-   software design pattern: Model-View-Controller (MVC)
-   runs inside a virtual environment: `virtualenv` (Python). That's why you must **always activate venv** with `. venv/bin/activate`, if you run it outside of Docker 
-   runs offline: `npm` downloads the JS packages and `parcel.js` bundles them, that they are executable in the project
-   deploy it on a server with: `gunicorn`


<a name="local_dev"></a>
# Getting started with local development
1. Create a working virtualenv with `make venv` and activate it with `. venv/bin/activate`

<a name="docker"></a>
## 1. Prepare configuration - Docker
Don't want to locally install a MySQL or MariaDB database? Use the included Docker setup.

1. Copy `.example.env` to `.env`
2. Use the example values or adapt them to your preference.
3. You can now start your database with `docker-compose up -d db`

<a name="init_database"></a>
## 2. Initialize the database
1. Open the Flask shell with `flask shell`
2. Get the model schemas with `from server.model import db`
3. Create the database and the tables with `db.create_all()`

### 2.1 Initialize the database in Docker
When using the docker setup, one can initialize the database by opening a shell inside the python docker container. This
is useful when there is no setup on the host machine to run the python code locally.

1. Start the python service with `docker-compose up -d p`
2. Open a shell inside the now running container with `docker-compose exec p /bin/bash`
3. Setup the database like normal in the steps above.

<a name="build_assets"></a>
## 3. Build assets
1. Install node modules with `npm install`
2. Bundle assets with `npm run build`

<a name="develop_assets"></a>
### 3.1 Develop assets
For a more convenient way of working with the CSS and JS assets, run `npm run watch`.

<a name="run_app"></a>
## 4. Finally: run the app
1. Start the app with `flask run`
2. Open http://localhost:5000/

<a name="advanced_config"></a>
# Advanced configuration
- the logging style is inside `logging.yaml`
- the app default env is "development". Set it to "production" with `export FLASK_ENV=production` before running it with `flask run`

<a name="deployment"></a>
# Deployment with Docker
This app includes a Docker setup for live deployment. Here is how to use it:

### Initial Setup
For the initial setup, just follow the instructions described in steps 1 and 2.1.

### Updating
The setup relies on mounting the code into the container, so code changes are relatively easy to propagate. However,
when the python dependencies change, a rebuild of the Docker image is necessary.

- Has your `requirements.txt` changed?
  1. Run `docker-compose build` to have Docker update the image with the new dependencies.
  2. Recreate the running containers with `docker-compose up -d p`    
  
- Only changes in code?
  1. If you changed your static files run: `npm run build`
  2. Gunicorn does not reload your code, so you need to restart your `p` service: `docker-compose restart p`

<a name="debugging"></a>
## Debugging
To debug gunicorn you can add the `--preload` flag to it. This will give you stack traces to errors that occurred. The
`--preload` flag is now set by default when using the Docker-Compose setup.

To see the logs of the `p` service run `docker-compose logs -f p`.
